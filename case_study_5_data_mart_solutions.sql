-- 2. Data Exploration
-- What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
-- What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
-- How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
-- What is the total sales for each region for each month?
-- What is the total count of transactions for each platform
-- What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
-- What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
-- Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?
-- Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? 
-- If not - how would you calculate it instead?

-- 3. Before & After Analysis
-- This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want 
-- to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

-- Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where 
-- the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

-- We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period 
-- after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

-- Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

-- What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? 
-- What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
-- What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
-- How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
